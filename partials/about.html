	<h3>About</h3>

	<p>This is a little field Archery scoreboard to help <a href="http://georgehenryrowe.co.uk">me</a> learn AngularJS. It is currently very rudimentry, nearly all the logic is in the html (dirty), but hopefully will get better!</p>
	<p>My plan is to sort out all the Angular code properly, get the scores posting to an API, and then wrap the web app up as a mobile app for use in the FIELD.</p>
